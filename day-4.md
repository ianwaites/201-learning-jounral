# Learning Journal: Day 4

4 days into the course and I have learned so much! I thought I knew a lot, especially about HTML and CSS, but I have come to find out I have a ton of bad habits! The course has been really refreshing to know that I am actually learning how to do things the correct way.

It's really important to know that I am doing things correctly and not the "lazy" way. For instance, using !important tags in CSS - I have always known to avoid using them as much as possible, but to change my mind set to NEVER use !important tags, but instead track down and solve the problem !important was being used to "fix" is the sign of a good developer. In my working experience we would throw around !important tags into existing CSS instead of putting in the time to track down and change the CSS and I never really thought twice about it - unless a bunch of !important tags were being used...

Day 3 was rough! We spent a lot time learning how to use JS loops and if/else statements and felt overwhelming at times. I really have a lot more to learn about them and look forward to the day where I feel 100% comfortable using them!

Day 4 we learned about CSS Layout and JS Functions. I am really excited for day 5 and to start diving into the functions even more! I know that functions will start to make our lives a little easier, but have the potential to really make things difficult at the same time.

Overall, I am really enjoying the courses progress and look forward to the coming weeks!
