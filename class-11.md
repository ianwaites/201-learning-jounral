# Class 11 Learning Journal

The lab for the class was a struggle for me. For some reason it took me a while to get my code up and running. It was like I knew what needed to be built but couldn't write the code for some reason. I eventually started to get code on the screen and was able to get the pictures to display and generate 3 new pictures with each click. So that felt good.

Prevent the pictures from displaying twice in a row is a whole other problem!
