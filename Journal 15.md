# Learning Journal 15

We are on the final stretch! This coming week is our Final Project Week! On Friday we found out our groups and I am super happy with the team I am a part of. I feel like we will be able to make a clean, well-designed app that will function correctly.

At this point I am open to any app idea. Since we are a group I would rather go with their ideas for what kind of app it will be and maybe suggest some features for it along the way.

I am really hoping that we are able to share in the development experience. I have heard some good ideas from other people on how to share the work load between the group and they sound very interesting! For instance, working in paired programming, having one person write out a function and then having another person write out the next function. I feel like that could be an awesome way to split up the work!

The main goal I want to preach is to keep our goals simple. Get basic functionality working. Then add features if we have time. I am really confident that we are going to make a beautiful app and want to make sure the backend is going to be as beautiful as the front end.
