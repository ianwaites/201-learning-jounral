# Class 13 Learning Journal

I really started to struggle with the Bus Mall project. I missed a day of class this week (I watched the lectures on YouTube) and that created a bunch of anxiety for me. I was scared that I was going to be far behind of everyone else and miss out on some essential information.

I ended up being ok, I made a lot of progress. However, I made the decision to start my Bus Mall project over from scratch. I want the reassurance that I could build my project from scratch without needed much help from anyone else.

I ended up building everything but had to get some help when it came to my validation to prevent images from showing up back to back. I also needed some help understanding the basic use of ChartJS (since that was the class I missed I wan't able to ask question I had about it).

All in all, things came together and I felt confident with what I had built. It isn't perfect, there are still some bugs to be cleaned up, but I am grateful to know there is no magic in the code. Everything makes sense.
