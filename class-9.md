Also learned a lot about making code more dry and building out validation in our salmon cookies project.

I've felt like I am getting a little behind in styling the pages and it's hard for me to think of a good layout because I don't like the images that were provided to me. They all seem dated and ugly - like they are kind of just ugly pictures. So that has been causing issues for me to build something out.
