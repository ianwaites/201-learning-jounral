# Learning Journal: Day 2

To day we learned about code structure and semantic HTML5. We also learned about JS Objects and Events and went a little bit into arrays. We were also taught about how the DOM + HTML + CSS + JS and how they all work together. We also discussed the MVC architecture and how things communicate on the backend of things.

One of the big things that stood out to me today was Sam talking about keeping up with current trends in coding and making sure to continue to learn and drop old habits! That is a big reason why I am attending this class. I could really relate to Sam talking about people using divs to create an entire page layout! I have been known to do such a thing, so it was really reassuring to know that Code Fellows will be teaching me the latest and greatest.

We also went over creating Git repo's and how to clone them and push or projects to them. This was a great intro! It made me realize that it's not as difficult as I was making it out to be.
