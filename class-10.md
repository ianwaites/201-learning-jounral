# Class 10 Learning Journal

This week was a fun one! Learning about Event Handlers and Constructors. We even got to talk a little about CSS layout which was awesome for me. Over the years I have developed some bad habits when it comes to writing CSS, so it's been awesome seeing the correct ways to go about things and comparing them to my bad habits. I have really been over complicating my CSS and incorrectly using some of the properties. While I have been able to achieve desired layouts, it seems I have been going about it the wrong (or long) way. So a few of the exercising this week have really been eye opening for me. Especially the wireframe exercise.

With all that being said, I am really looking forward to the coming week and cant believe we are already half way through 201!
